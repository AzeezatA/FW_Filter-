This is a Flywheel Gear

BSLPreProcessing Filter---(bslfilter v0.0.9)

Designed to fix the bug in the bslpp filter 
This gear "patch" can be run after older versions of ppbsltargeting to fix the bug with the filter.

Defults are:
highpass_cutoff= 0.1
lowpass_cutoff	0.01 {Bandpass Filter Only applyed to resting state data be sure the acquisitions files are labled 'rest', 'REST', 'resting' etc }
highpass_cutoff_TASKDATA= 0.01 {Highpass Filter Only applied to task data}

input:fmriprep_BSLPP_0.0.2.zip (from oldversion of ppbsltargeting)
output: fmriprep_BSLPP_0.0.8.zip
   - The dir and paths will be the same so you can run ftarget v3.0.9 after or other gears

Note: For larger run(many acquisitions files or multiple sessions please use the HighCPU tag=high-cpu)
